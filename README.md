# Jordanian Currency Calculator 🇯🇴

A simple C++ program that breaks down a total amount of money (in Shillings) into Jordanian banknotes and coins.

## How it works
1. The program asks you to enter the total number of **Shillings**.
2. It calculates how many banknotes and coins are needed for that amount.
3. It prints the count for each category:
   - **Banknotes:** 50, 20, 10, 5, 1 JD.
   - **Coins:** 0.5, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05 JD.

### Example
If you enter `1000` Shillings, the program will output:
- **Fifty Dinars:** 1
